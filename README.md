# sherp2.0

> **Note:** This is Logan's maintained fork of Sherpbot, originally based on [Sooraj-beep/sherp2.0](https://github.com/Sooraj-beep/sherp2.0).

sherp2.0 is a discord bot that answers frequently asked questions for students at the University of Alberta. It is currently operable on the unofficial University of Alberta CS discord server. Students can contribute to the bots knowledge database by contributing to `data`

- Request Kattis problems based on difficulty and other parameters (credit: @GurveerSohal)
- Slash Commands (credit: @DhanrajHira)
- Starboard (credit: @ArtDynasty13)

- Shortcuts to copypastas popular on the CS discord server

## Leaderboards
Sherp keeps two leaderboards: one for OnPhone reactions (starboard) and one for ban reactions (wall of shame). Everyone starts at 0 and both work the same way:
- Reacting to a message with the board's emoji costs you 1 point. Removing the reaction before the message reaches the board refunds it.
- When the message is posted to the board, everyone still reacting gets +2 (a net +1). Those points are kept even if they un-react later.
- Reactions added once the message is already on the board are free and earn nothing.
- Once the message has reached the board, its author gets 1 point for every reaction of that emoji on it, updated as reactions are added or removed (their own reaction doesn't count).
- If a message is deleted before it reaches the board, everyone who reacted to it is refunded.
- Bots, NSFW channels and the board channels themselves are ignored.

Commands (use them as slash commands or with the `?` prefix):
- `/leaderboard` / `/wosleaderboard`: top 10 of the OnPhone / wall of shame leaderboard, visible to everyone.
- `/position` / `/wosposition`: your rank and the 5 members above and below you, visible only to you. The `?` prefix versions send the result by DM.

Scores and the boards' posts are stored in a SQLite file (`db/boards.db` by default, set `db_path` under `[boards]` in `bot_config.toml` to change it), so both keep working for older messages after the bot restarts. When running in Docker, mount the `db/` directory on a volume (e.g. `-v sherp-db:/app/db`), otherwise they are lost when the container is recreated.

## Polls and votes
Anyone can post a poll in `#active_polls` or a vote in `#active_votes` and close their own whenever they like. Both use Discord's built-in polls, so members pick one option and can see the live results.

- `?open_poll Question | Option 1 | Option 2`: post a poll. Separate the question and each option with `|`. A poll needs 2 to 10 options; the question can be up to 300 characters and each option up to 55.
- `?open_vote Question | Option 1 | Option 2`: post a vote, in the same format.
- `?close_poll` / `?close_vote`: pick one of your open polls or votes from a menu to close it. Voting stops and the final results stay visible in the channel.

The only difference is that when a vote closes, its results are also posted in `#mod_chat`. Discord ends a poll automatically after 32 days; the bot then treats it as closed, and posts a vote's results in `#mod_chat` as usual.

The bot finds the channels by name (`active_polls`, `active_votes` and `mod_chat`), or by the channel IDs under `[polls]` in `bot_config.toml`. It needs the View Channel, Send Messages, Send Polls and Read Message History permissions there, and Manage Messages to tidy up commands used inside the poll channels. Open polls and votes are tracked in a SQLite file (`db/polls.db` by default, set `db_path` under `[polls]` to change it), which should live on the same persistent volume as the boards database.

## Running the bot locally
**Note:** If all you want to do is add new commands then you dont need to setup the bot, You can just clone the repo and contribute to `data/commands.json` or any of the other files in `data` folder. For more advanced changes, it is recommended to get a discord bot running locally to test functionality.

Here are the steps you need to follow if you want to run the bot locally for testing purposes:

### Prerequisites:
1. A discord server that you can invite the bot to and do testing.
2. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Steps:
1. Create a discord bot for testing using the Discord Developer Portal https://discord.com/developers/applications
    * Click on "New Application" and provide a name for your bot (make sure you try to give it a unique name), then accept terms of service and click Create.
    * Once created, you will be redirected to the bot dashboard where you can configure its settings.
         1. Select the Bot section under settings, click on Reset Token, and save the token somewhere (you will need it later).
         2. You will also need the bots application ID. This can also be found in the developer dashboard under General Information.
         3. Scroll down and check all options under Privileged Gateway Intents then save changes.
         4. Under OAuth2 select URL Generator and select bot from SCOPES.
         5. under bot permissions check the following:
             * Read Messages/View Channels
             * Send Messages
             * Embed Links
             * Attach files
    * Click on copy beside the generated URL and paste it into your browser's search bar. You will be prompted 
      by Discord to invite it to your server. Invite it to the server you created earlier.
2. Running the bot
   * Clone the repo and cd into the root directory
   * Create a .env file and add your bot token like this:
```python
BOT_TOKEN = 'MTEwMjMzNzc5ODQ1NzAxNjUyMw.GsbpKF.6Vocc_sXkDgXcH9Yv_Hhbayz6zhjc2FIgA4H9k'
```
   * install dependencies using:
```bash
uv sync --dev
```
   * run the bot using:
```
uv run python bot.py
```
   * when running the bot for the first time, please run `?sync` in order for slash commands to work without issue
